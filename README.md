# Boost for Actions
This repository contains the code and scripts that we use to prepare Boost packages used in [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).  
The file [versions-manifest.json](./versions-manifest.json) contains the list of available and released versions.  

> Caution: this is prepared for and only permitted for use by actions `virtual-environments`.

**Status**: Currently under development and in use for beta and preview actions. This repo is undergoing rapid changes.

## Adding new versions
We are trying to prepare packages for new versions of Boost as soon as they are released. Please open an issue if any versions are missing.
